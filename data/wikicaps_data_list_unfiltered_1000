The Kankai Ibun is an account of their journey when they were sent off-course en route to the capital, Edo. The fishermen were rescued by a Russian ship and taken to late 18th / early 19th century Europe and, most especially, Russia.; The cargo ship, Wakamiyamaru, left from the port of Ishimaki in Sendai-han, today’s Miyagi Prefecture, in Japan carrying rice and lumber with 16 crew members for Edo, today’s Tokyo, on November 27th, 1793. Shipwrecked and drifted in the Pacific Ocean for half a year, they finally landed in one of the islands of the Andreanof Islands, a part of the Aleutian Islands on May 10th, 1794. They were transferred to Irkutsk by Russians where they stayed until the spring of 1803. They were then called in by Alexander I of Russia to St. Petersburg where they stayed from April to June in 1803, and from where they started their journey back home.

As you may have heard via the sexy Sydney grapevine, Ricki-Lee Coulter made an appearance on Who magazine's sought-after Sexiest People issue, which is out next flirty Friday. Ms Sexy was also tonight's guest performer (in public) at Who's Sexiest People Party in the Great Hall at the University of Sydney. We've been told it was her birthday, which is a pretty sexy occasion in our lives if you think about it. She looks good for 26th don't you think. "Losing weight has given me an extra boost," Coulter told Who magazine. "But I think back to when I met my boyfriend (Richard Harrison) and I was the heaviest I've ever been. "It didn't bother me...I still flicked my hair around and did my thing. Losing weight has certainly boosted my confidence but I think I have always been self-assured." Woman's Day, an ACP Magazine title, has parted with a considerable amount of money for a number of exclusive stories and photos with her. Did you catch her "tits and ass" shoot with Maxim magazine? It's pretty hot and not much is left to the imagination. On being her sexy self, RCL says: "I'm not opposed to being naked, so my ultimate sexy night in would be sans clothes, some candles and maybe some massage oil ... things can get sexy pretty quickly! "I would highly recommend staying away from the stove and trying to cook dinner when you are naked, though — order takeaway instead!" she told Who. Speaking of other sexy bodies, you should have seen Lara Bingle tonight. Some media chat centred around her little belly and if she may have been pregnant or not. For the record names present included Lara Bingle, Ricci-Lee Coulter, Brynne & Geoffrey Edelsten, Esither Anderson, Charlotte Dawson, Samara Weaving, Montana Cox and Rebecca Breeds. The latest arrivals were 'The Veronicas' (Jessica and Lisa Origliasso), who have only just started get back into the public and media eye after a few years or laying pretty low. Well done to David Grant and the team at dg3 Event Management who helped put on a golden night of entertainment, glam and sexiness. Guess who is getting sexy tonight, and we're taken, but in sexy Sydney you shouldn't have too much trouble in getting naked with a like minded individual or three. We can't wait till next year to do it all over again.

The Kankai Ibun is an account of their journey when they were sent off-course en route to the capital, Edo. The fishermen were rescued by a Russian ship and taken to late 18th / early 19th century Europe and, most especially, Russia.; The cargo ship, Wakamiyamaru, left from the port of Ishimaki in Sendai-han, todayas Miyagi Prefecture, in Japan carrying rice and lumber with 16 crew members for Edo, todayas Tokyo, on November 27th, 1793. Shipwrecked and drifted in the Pacific Ocean for half a year, they finally landed in one of the islands of the Andreanof Islands, a part of the Aleutian Islands on May 10th, 1794. They were transferred to Irkutsk by Russians where they stayed until the spring of 1803. They were then called in by Alexander I of Russia to St. Petersburg where they stayed from April to June in 1803, and from where they started their journey back home. They were included in the Rezanov mission on the first Russian global circumnavigation by a ship Nadezhda. It took them 16 months to reach the port of Nagasaki, Japan in September, 1804 since they left in June, 1803. Of the sixteen, five crewmen got on board. Four returned home in Sendai; one, who had become an interpreter, returned to Russia with Rezanov. :"Legacy Record ID": rbm-m818 :"Filename": RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~001; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~002; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~003; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~004; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~005; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~006; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~007; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~008; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~009; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~010; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~011; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~012; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~013; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~014; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~015; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~016; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~017; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~018; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~019; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~020; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~021; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~022; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~023; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~024; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~025; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~026; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~027; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~028; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~029; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~030; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~031; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~032; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~033; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~034; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~035; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~036; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~037; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~038; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~039; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~040; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~041; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~042; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~043; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~044; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~045; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~046; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~047; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~048; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~049; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~050; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~051; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~052; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~053; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~054; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~055; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~056; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~057; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~058; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~059; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~060; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~061; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~062; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~063; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~064; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~065; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~066; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~067; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~068; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~069; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~070; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~071; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~072; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~073; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~074; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~075; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~076; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~077; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~078; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~079; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~080; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~081; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~082; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~083; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~084; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~085; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~086; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~087; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~088; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~089; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~090; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~091; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~092; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~093; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~094; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~095; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~096; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~097; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~098; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~099; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~100; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~101; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~102; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~103; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~104; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~105; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~106; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~107; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~108; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~109; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~110; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~111; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~112; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~113; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~114; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~115; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~116; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~117; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~118; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~119; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~120; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~121; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~122; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~123; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~124; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~125; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~126; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~127; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~128; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~129; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~130; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~131; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~132; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~133; RBM-910-41-O88k-v2~134 :"Access Conditions": Send requests to address or e-mail given.

The cornerstone for the church was laid in 1891, nearly three years after Drumgoole's death. Only the facade of the church, shown here, survived a serious fire in 1973. However the church was rebuilt in 1976, keeping the old facade. This shows how it looked in August 2015.

612|||File:Taylor Dayne Sydney Australian Tour (6240262447).jpg|||Taylor Dayne, American freestyle music, and smooth jazz artist from New York City, is continuing to love her Australian tour and the many fans who still remember her. The Diva who enjoyed mainstream popularity in the 1980s is wowing Aussie audiences and showing that she's still got it. Without her there may never have never been an Anastacia. Almost 25 years ago, the chart success of American dance-pop singer Taylor Dayne paved a golden road for the mighty-voiced white female soul-pop singers who came after her. Tonight for Dayne it was Selina's at the famous Coogee Bay Hotel in Sydney's east. The sensational Dayne sounded fresh and looked great in a blue, green, silver and orange sequin leotard. It was obvious she appreciated the audience and did a lot of eye contact and finger pointing at both fans and the lucky photographers on hand. Dayne performed hits, including Tell It to My Heart, With Every Beat of My Heart, Prove Your Love, I’ll Be Your Shelter and Don’t Rush Me. I loved the way she worked the stool, complete with cross over legs, working the audience, and of course the support dancers followed her lead. Oh, she still oozes sexiness also. “You can shoot for the stars - and I think everybody should - but I remember having some very frustrating moments thinking ‘God, is it ever going to happen?’ ” she said. “But from the minute Tell It to My Heart broke in Europe as a single - I remember I showed up at one store and there were 1000 kids dressed like me - I never looked back.” Ms Dayne had said her Australian fans would not be disappointed when they came to see her, and she was speaking the truth. "I have been performing for 23 years and I promise I will not come out looking like Taylor Dayne from 1988, but I will take my fans on a journey," she said. "It’s a soundtrack to their lives as much as mine." The 49-year-old singer and songwriter lives in Los Angeles where she raises her two children, eight-year-old twins Astaria and Levi whom she had via a surrogate and without a partner. "I wouldn't have done it any other way, which is the story of my career," Dayne says. "No one has ever handed me anything. If you have a goal and a dream, I don't think anyone can stop you. Kids and a career have both been the most difficult and satisfying things in my life." Tickets to some of her Australian shows can be purchased for as low at $50, so snap them up. If you're into music with heart and love Taylor Dayne is for you. The Music News Australia network would like to publicly thank Taylor for putting on such a great show, looking our camera lots, and also the great folks at Lionel Midford Publicity for helping make it all possible. Support was Andrew Lawson from The X-Factor fame. Mr Lawson continues to improve, building upon his foundation and fame from X-Factor. Mr Lawson was appreciative of the fans and did a good job of connecting with both them and the press that was present. We think his best days are still ahead of him, but it was a thumbs up. All up, a great night of entertainment.

665|||File:Michael Walsh - DI, 2015.01.13 (9).JPG|||Live on the 13th of January, 2015. Budapest, Vigadó. Makovecz Room. High Noon, film screening. Danube Institute. Following the showing of the film Michael Walsh, American film and music critic, screenwriter and novelist examined the film and the reasons why it remained a still-controversial classic. High Noon (film, starring Gary Cooper) won four Academy awards, was written by a Communist, Carl Foreman, who was later blacklisted by the Hollywood studios, due to his being called during the movie's production before the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was investigating Communist influence in Hollywood; in fact, HIGH NOON was his last screen credit for several years. Many have seen the script as Foreman's reaction to the political circumstances of the time. And yet today, it plays as the epitome of rugged individualism against any kind of collectivism. Howard Hawks made Rio Bravo (starring John Wayne) a kind of answer to High Noon, because he didn't believe that a good sheriff would go running around town asking for other people's help to do his job.

Apart from the natural beauty and climate, what remains deepest in my memory is the warmth and friendship of the people and a national pride driven by the heartbeat of culture and civilisation. I hope that this selection of photos conveys some of that. The importance of Tunisia’s growth as a nation post World War II, and the example it set in gender equality and education are second to none. Tunisia was prepared to challenge and change; it is a beacon to all seeking equality, justice and peace. Nicholas Gosse, 2015

My Father had been living in Tombuctoo, but removed to be King in Teembo, in Foota Jallo. his name was Almam Abrahim. I was five years old when my father carried me from Tombuctoo. I lived in Teembo, mostly, until I was twenty one and followed the horesen. I was made Captain when I wasn twenty-one - after they put me to that , and found that I have a vergy good head, at twenty-four they made me Colonel. At the age of twenty six, they sent me to fight the Hebohs, because they destroyed the vessels taht came to the coast, and prevented our trade. When we fought, I defeated them. But they wen tback one hundred miles into the country, and hid themselves in the mountain. We coud not see them, and didn not expect there was any enemy. When we got there we, dismounted and led our hourses, until we were half way up the mountain. Theyn they fired upon us. We saw the smoke, we heard the guns, wes saw the people drop down. I told every one to run until we reached the top of the hill, then to wait for each other until all came there, and we would fight them. After I had arrived as the summit, i could see no one excpet my guard. they followed us, and we ran and fought. I saw this would not do. i told every one to run who wished to do so. Every one who wished to run , fled. I said I will not run for a Kufr. I got down from my horse and sat down. .........They sold me directly, with fity others, to an English ship. They took me to the Islamd of Dominica. After that I was taken to New Orleans. they the took me to Natchez and Colonel Foster brought me. I hae lived with Colonel Foster 40 years. thirty years I laboured hard. the last ten years I have been indulged a good deal. I have left five children behind and eight grand children. I feel sad, to think of leaving my children behind me. I desire to go back to my own country again; but when I think of my childre, it hurts my feelings. If I go to my own country, I cannot fell happy, if my children are left. I hope by God's assistance, to recover them.

The photo depicts a tourist house on Spitsbergen Island, part of the Svalvard Archipelago, located within the Arctic Circle, some 550 kilometers north of the Norwegian mainland. There were no tourist accommodations on Spitsbergen until around 1896, when the Vesteraalens Steamship Company constructed a tourist house along the coast of Advent Bay to accommodate an influx of visitors. The Detroit Photographic Company was launched as a photographic publishing firm in the late 1890s by Detroit businessman and publisher William A. Livingstone, Jr. and photographer and photo-publisher Edwin H. Husher. They obtained the exclusive rights to use the Swiss "Photochrom" process for converting black-and-white photographs into color images and printing them by photolithography. This process permitted the mass production of color postcards, prints, and albums for sale to the American market. Hotels; Tourism; Wooden buildings

Two distinct façades, both of them showing the influence of the curve redolent of the work of the Reus-born maestro, arouse our curiosity to go and take a closer look at this beautiful and unique building. The architect Salvador Valeri i Pupurull worked on the Casa Comalat from 1906 to 1911, and was clearly influenced by Gaudi's organic forms. Dating from the final phase of the "modernista" era, this is a highly original building comprising two façades with a common element: the Gaudiesque curve. The main façade, which overlooks Barcelona's Avinguda Diagonal, is made of stone and is more symmetrical and regular in shape. At street level, there is an interesting wrought-iron doorway and, above it, a central gallery surmounted by a pinnacle. At the top, a series of openings cut into the façade and surrounded by stone garlands jut out above the remaining curved balconies with their floral motifs. The building is surmounted by a turret in the shape of a harlequin's hat clad in glazed green ceramics. This colourful element dominates the rear façade of the building which overlooks Carrer Rosselló, and is freer and more informal in style. The irregular wooden galleries give the façade a dynamic look, and the ceramics that decorate the entire façade lend a splash of colour. The parabolic arches over the doors on the ground floor give the building its Gaudiesque feel, and are just another example of the beauty of this unique building.

Therefore in this artistic impression the proportion of the forehead was slightly enlarged, thus producing what is probably a more precise depiction.

886|||File:Arch of Hadrian. Jerash, Jordan 45.JPG|||The Arch of Hadrian in Jerash, Jordan is an 11-metre high triple-arched gateway erected to honor the visit of Roman Emperor Hadrian to the city (then called Gerasa) in the winter of 129–130. The Arch originally stood to almost 22 m and probably had wooden doors. The arch features some unconventional, possibly Nabataean, architectural features, such as acanthus bases. The columns are decorated with capitals at the bottom rather than the top. The monument served both as a commemorative arch and as an approach to Gerasa. The Arch's relative remoteness from the city walls points to a plan for southward expansion of Gerasa during its heyday. The expansion, however, has not been implemented. In 2005, the arch was under restoration. Other arches, named in Hadrian's honor, have been built in other places as well.

Nevertheless you have a restaurant and a rocker store there which are financed with non traditional methods. In the restaurant at the turning Marktgasse they insult foreign tourists and peoples in many cases as observers. Lesbian couples walking to date spots on the fortress and telling something about.

It completes a journey began at the academy campus in Salemburg, N.C.. A tough, hard challenge started 22 weeks ago with a residential military style school of equal parts discipline, service, duty and education. Perhaps the prayer led by a now graduate of the academy puts it best. "Thank you for this second chance." The cadets earned this chance by more than 8,500 hours of service to the community. They volunteered at a local senior living center, food bank, the Adopt a Road program, state park conservation, disaster preparedness, other civic organizations and the Special Olympics. "We will remember this for rest of our lives," said Zachary R.M. Jessie, academic honor graduate during the ceremony.
